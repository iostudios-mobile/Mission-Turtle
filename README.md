# Mission Turtle

This is a top-down maze game involving a turtle as the main character of this 
game. This project was initially created as my end-of-year school project. 

## Overview
The game itself is simple: using the arrow or WASD keys, you would need to
guide a turtle character into a water portal. Before the turtle enters the water
it must collect enough food for the level.
